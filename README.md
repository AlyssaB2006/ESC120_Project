# ESC120_Project
My contributions to a group freshman engineering project. We wanted to create an automatic road sign reader, possibly to be used in autonomous driving or as a safety feature in cars.

My role in the project was to organize tasks among three other freshman engineering students as well as program the computer vision side of the sign reader. 

In 15 weeks, we were able to complete all assignments for the class, finish out with an 'A' grade, and create a proof of concept prototype for our final presentation. 

One other peer was tasked with creating an Arduino display which would replicate a driver's HUD as well as a blinking light and buzzer for when a sign was detected. Another researched computer neural networks and machine learning in the hopes of creating a neural network for reading the symbols on a sign rather than just words. The final group member was not often in class and was asked to help out with presentations and in-class assignments due to his disinterest in working outside of class time.

My python script will isolate the yellow parts of an image (we only wanted it to read the yellow warning signs), identify the shape of the sign based on the number of sides, and read any text on the sign. It will output the text and the shape of the sign. As this is an unifinished project, there is not much technical application of the program. I, however, learned a great deal about computer vision and project management through this project.
